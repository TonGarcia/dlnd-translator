# # Language Translation
# In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation.  You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.
# ## Get the Data
# Since translating the whole language of English to French will take lots of time to train, we have provided you with a small portion of the English corpus.

# ### Text to Word Ids
# As you did with other RNNs, you must turn the text into a number so the computer can understand it. In the function `text_to_ids()`, you'll turn `source_text` and `target_text` from words to ids.  However, you need to add the `<EOS>` word id at the end of `target_text`.  This will help the neural network predict when the sentence should end.
# 
# You can get the `<EOS>` word id by doing:
# ```python
# target_vocab_to_int['<EOS>']
# ```
# You can get other word ids using `source_vocab_to_int` and `target_vocab_to_int`.

# ## Imperfect Translation
# You might notice that some sentences translate better than others.  Since the dataset you're using only has a vocabulary of 227 English words of the thousands that you use, you're only going to see good results using these words.  For this project, you don't need a perfect translation. However, if you want to create a better translation model, you'll need better data.
# 
# You can train on the [WMT10 French-English corpus](http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/training-giga-fren.tar).  This dataset has more vocabulary and richer in topics discussed.  However, this will take you days to train, so make sure you've a GPU and the neural network is performing well on dataset we provided.  Just make sure you play with the WMT10 corpus after you've submitted this project.
# ## Submitting This Project
# When submitting this project, make sure to run all the cells before saving the notebook. Save the notebook file as "dlnd_language_translation.ipynb" and save it as a HTML file under "File" -> "Download as". Include the "helper.py" and "problem_unittests.py" files in your submission.
